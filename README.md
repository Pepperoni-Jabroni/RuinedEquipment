Grieving equipment owner? With this mod installed, Tools and Armors break into Ruined forms (for players). The Ruined equipment can then be repaired in either a Crafting Grid or Anvil or, if you're like me, kept as a keepsake. May you never forget your fallen tools and armors & the adventures you had with them.

**Features**:
- Ruined varieties of the following Items:
   - All vanilla Tools/Swords
   - All vanilla Armors (including Turtle Shell)
   - Shields
   - Misc: Shears, Flint & Steel, Bow, Crossbow, Trident, Fishing Rod
- Tools & Armors will become "Ruined" when their durability reaches 0 (and you hear the break sound).
- Ruined equipment keeps it's name, enchantments (although the enchantments no longer functionally do anything), dyes (if leather armor), and banner pattern (if shield).
- You have 4 choices when you receive a Ruined item.
   1. Keep it as a keepsake, remember it always.
   2. Combine the Ruined item with either another Ruined item of the same type or the corresponding non-Ruined item in a Crafting Grid in order to repair the item, but lose all other features (name, enchantments, etc).
   3. Repair the Ruined item using an Anvil with either it's corresponding repair material or the corresponding non-Ruined item. This will apply all features (name, enchantments, etc) to the resulting Item.
   4. Make your Ruined item **"Empowered"** by combining it with a Netherite Scrap in a Crafting Grid. Now, when you repair the item at an Anvil, all the existing Enchantments will become **max value**.
